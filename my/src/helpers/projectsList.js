Product rendering is handled dynamically through JavaScript logic, while the HTML structure primarily consists of the navbar and footer elements to ensure a consistent layout across all pages. Material-UI has been instrumental in creating a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.",

The site allows you to choose a product, enter personal details, which are then added to the database in the client table. You can then place an order, which in turn will also be added to the database. Finally, you can proceed to pay for the product, and the payment information will similarly be inserted into the database. As the title suggests, it's a mini full-stack website.",
